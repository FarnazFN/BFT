    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p>After reflecting and spending time on the process from the start to finish of  this project, stated below is our PMI analysis. </p>
    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong> The positive part of this group project for us was the collaboration and pair programming. It taught us how to improve our perspective by viewing other people's ways of web developing.</p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong> At times, it was difficult for us to reach an agreement on the design since we all have different views. </p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong> While looking at one another's codes sometimes, we had conflict because we had different approaches to the project. However, we were always able to reach meaningful agreement and work together as a team which is what we think made the project a success.</p>
